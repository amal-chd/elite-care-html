                                 <p>In the event any part or other product is damaged during shipment to the Customer, unless the Customer gives Innovative Radiology written notice of such damage within three (3) days of delivery, the Customer waives any claim against Innovative Radiology for any determinable deficiency or defect in said delivery or product. Customer agrees to inspect all material and equipment immediately upon delivery to verify: (a) the quantities described in the accompanying delivery ticket are the quantities delivered and (b) there are no visible defects. The Customer also agrees to examine all delivery tickets and invoices upon receipt. In the event the Customer directs Elite Care to deliver an equipment or material, and the Customer does not have a representative present at the time of delivery, the Customer authorizes Innovative Radiology, or its designated carrier, to leave the equipment or material at the designated place of delivery. Upon said delivery, the Customer will be responsible for the equipment or material. The Customer authorizes any of its employees to sign a rental or purchase agreement for such equipment or material and agrees to be bound by all the terms of said agreement.</p>

                                 <p>RETURN OF GOOD PARTS:</p>
                                 <p>If you are returning a part for restock:</p>
                                 <ul type="disc">
                                    <li>You must contact Innovative Radiology within 5 days of receiving the part(s).</li>
                                    <li>The part must be received at Innovative Radiology within 10 days of notification, or sooner if requested.</li>
                                    <li>The RMA number must appear on the box and/or return shipping label. Returns without an RMA number will not be accepted, nor will any return credit be issued.</li>
                                    <li>The part must be received unaltered. Parts that are tampered with will not be credited.</li>

                                 <h3>WARRANTY:</h3>
                                 <p>Our standard parts warranty is 90 days beginning date of initial delivery unless specified otherwise. Innovative Radiology must be notified of a warranty claim within the standard or otherwise specified warranty period in order to qualify for a replacement or warranty credit. Innovative Radiology reserves the right to send a replacement, if available, in lieu of issuing a refund or credit. If a replacement part is refused, Innovative Radiology reserves the right to bill restocking fees as detailed in the section above. The warranty part must be returned within 10 days of the date of notification. If the sale was on an exchange basis, the original exchange part is still required. Failure to return warranty parts may result in additional billing at the discretion of Innovative Radiology. The warranty shall not cover damage caused by misuse or abuse, fire, water, building collapse, power failure or fluctuations, vandalism, riot, air conditioning failure, or “acts of god” (i.e. tornado, hurricane, earthquake, etc). Warranty returns without an RMA number will not be accepted, nor will any return credit be issued.</p>
                                 <h3>EXCHANGE PARTS:</h3>
                                 <p>Certain transactions require a like, repairable part due back to Innovative Radiology (Exchange Parts). If your transaction was made on an exchange basis, then an exchange part is required. To qualify as a “like” part, it must be complete and have the same part number, unless otherwise approved by an authorized Innovative Radiology representative. All exchange parts are subject to review, and additional billing may occur for parts that do not meet the set criteria. This exchange part must be received within 15 days of the Innovative Radiology invoice date, otherwise an additional billing may occur up to the OEM outright list price exclusive of any additional shipping charges</p>
                                 <h3>RETURN OF DOA PARTS:</h3>
                                 <p>DOA (Dead on Arrival) parts must be reported as soon as the defective state is discovered. In the interest of fairness to both Innovative Radiology and our customers, the following must occur:</p>

Innovative Radiology reserves the right to amend a customer’s payment terms as our sole discretion based solely on a customer’s payment history. Customer agrees to pay a service charge on the outstanding balance for which payment has not been received according to terms stated. The service charge shall be one and one-half percent (1 ½%) per month of the customer’s outstanding past-due balance after deducting current payments and credits. Such service charges shall become part of the customer’s outstanding balance. The person or persons signing any Innovative Radiology Credit Application and Agreement hereby personally guarantee any indebtedness incurred to Innovative Radiology and waive presentment and demand for payment, notice of non-payment, protest and notice of protest, and consent without notice of any extensions of time or increase in the amount of the credit given. This is intended to be a continuing guarantee and shall continue as to all new indebtedness incurred unless and until a written notice is served upon Innovative Radiology Certified Mail-Return Receipt Requested declaring said personal guarantee should not apply to future purchases. Additional billing invoices will be issued if an exchange, DOA, or otherwise returnable part is not received per agreed upon terms and at the discretion of Innovative Radiology. Innovative Radiology reserves the right to charge any credit card on file to fulfill payment of any past due billing invoices. At least one notification will be sent before any credit card is charged in this manner.</p>

These changes will be effective immediately for new users of our Site.

                                 Dispute Resolution. Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights.  It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.
                                 <strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</strong> All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms or the use of any product or service provided by the Company that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  Unless otherwise agreed to, all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under the Terms.
                                 <strong>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</strong> Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to the Company should be sent to: 1390 Business Center Dr SW #700, Conyers, GA 30094. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award to which either party is entitled.
                                 <strong>Arbitration Rules.</strong> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association, an established alternative dispute resolution provider that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay you the greater of the award or $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
                                 <strong>Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.</strong> If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
                                 <strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
                                 <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.
                                 <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
                                 <strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong> All claims and disputes within the scope of this arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other customer or user.
                                 <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding shall be strictly confidential.  The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
                                 <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
                                 <strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Arbitration Agreement.
                                 <strong>Survival of Agreement.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company.
                                 <strong>Small Claims Court.</strong> Nonetheless the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.
                                 <strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
                                 <strong>Claims Not Subject to Arbitration.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&#8217;s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
                                 In any circumstances where the foregoing Arbitration Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within ge County, California, for such purposes.
                                 The Site may be subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree not to export, re-export, or transfer, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from Company, or any products utilizing such data, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.

                                 <strong>Electronic Communications.</strong> The communications between you and Company use electronic means, whether you use the Site or send us emails, or whether Company posts notices on the Site or communicates with you via email.

                                 <strong>Entire Terms.</strong> These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. The word &#8220;including&#8221; means &#8220;including without limitation&#8221;. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Your relationship to Company is that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent or partner of the other.  These Terms, and your rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without Company&#8217;s prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void.  Company may freely assign these Terms.  The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms shall be binding upon assignees.
